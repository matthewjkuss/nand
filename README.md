# Nand

Long term, I hope to be able to simulate the Hack machine from [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) with a [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/) style interface.

Currently, I have implemented enough code to simulate a multiplexer, and visualise it with basic graphics and navigation capabilities.

A proof of concept is live now, at <https://matthewjkuss.github.io/nand/>!
