Notes:

- Make zoomed out chip size big enough to hold internals
- Make Nand gates all the same size
- Display contents of chip on hover
- Display names of chips only when big enough to read them
- Clicking on chip selects it, which
  - zooms in on it,
  - exposes its internals (without need for hover),
  - adds it to breadcrumb,
  - and displays details in panel.
  - Maybe also elevates it (using drop shadow, Material Design-style)
- Display of chips is like design of chips
  - From left to right, display lines of actions
  - Alternate between wire rearranging and Actions (wires + chips + nands)
  - Consider adding "Pipeline" action, which allows multiple chips in a row (so that, for example three Nots could run along side one Add)
  - Or perhaps a "Group" action, which is like a chip for the purposes of layout
